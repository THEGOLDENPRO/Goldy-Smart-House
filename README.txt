A shity python module that allows a Google Assistant device (Google Home, etc) to run code on your computer. 

The Libary allows your google assistant to run commands/functions in your code and also allows you to return a string back to a device like the google home if included IP address of the device which was assigned by your router.

Just made this for a YouTube video but I might actually update it and fix my code in the future.
